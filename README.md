# Brokkr
Brokkr is my custom 3D printer. It started life as a Makerfarm Peg 12. But all that remains of that is the frame, and the heated bed. This is the custom configured Marlin firmware for the printer to be run on a RAMPS 1.4 Board. Soon the printer will be migrated to Marlin 2.0 on a 32 bit board.

### Specs of printer:
* Print area: (300x300x300mm)
* E3D V6
* Prusa Style Extruder
* Meanwel 300W power supply

### notes:
Lib_1.png & Lib_2.png are all isntalled Library for the firmware. Theses are for trouble shooting.
